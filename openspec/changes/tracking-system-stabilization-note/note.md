# Tracking System Status Note

## Date: 2025-10-29

## Status: STABILIZED ✅

## Summary

The order tracking system has returned to normal operation. All previous issues with 500 errors have been resolved, and the system is now functioning reliably without requiring further modifications to `next.config.ts`.

## Current State

### next.config.ts Configuration
- **Status**: Clean and minimal
- **Configuration**: PWA-only configuration
- **Tracking-related modifications**: None required
- **Server-side processing**: Minimal (as intended)

### System Performance
- **500 Errors**: Eliminated
- **Guest Access**: Fully functional
- **Order Tracking**: Reliable operation
- **Mobile/Desktop**: Both working correctly

## Key Observations

1. **Configuration Stability**: The `next.config.ts` file no longer requires tracking-related modifications
2. **Server Processing**: Minimal server-side processing approach has proven effective
3. **Client-Side Service**: Simple client-side queries are working reliably
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries prevent system crashes

## Implications for Future Development

### No Further Changes Expected
- `next.config.ts` should remain in its current minimal state
- No additional server-side processing requirements anticipated
- Current architecture is sustainable for production use

### Maintenance Guidelines
- Keep `next.config.ts` minimal (PWA configuration only)
- Maintain simple client-side data fetching approach
- Preserve error boundary implementations
- Continue monitoring for any performance issues

## Related OpenSpec Changes

This status note relates to the previously completed change:
