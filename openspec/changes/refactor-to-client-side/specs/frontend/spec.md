## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Component Data Fetching
All components SHALL fetch data using client-side Supabase browser client instead of API route calls.

#### Scenario: Admin dashboard data loading
- **WHEN** admin dashboard loads
- **THEN** components use Supabase browser client to fetch required data
- **AND** loading states are shown during data fetching
- **AND** error handling manages failed data requests gracefully

#### Scenario: Data table operations
- **WHEN** admin uses data tables for orders, customers, or services
- **THEN** table components query Supabase browser client directly
- **AND** pagination and filtering are handled client-side
- **AND** real-time updates refresh table data automatically

#### Scenario: Form submissions
- **WHEN** users submit forms (login, order creation, registration)
- **THEN** form handlers use Supabase browser client for data operations
- **AND** optimistic updates provide immediate UI feedback
- **AND** rollbacks handle failed operations gracefully

#### Scenario: Search and filtering
- **WHEN** users search for customers, orders, or tracking information
- **THEN** search queries use Supabase browser client directly
- **AND** filtering is performed through Supabase query builders
- **AND** search results are paginated and cached appropriately

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Client-Side State Management
The application SHALL implement comprehensive client-side state management for data and UI state.

#### Scenario: Data caching
- **WHEN** data is fetched from Supabase
- **THEN** frequently accessed data is cached client-side
- **AND** cache invalidation keeps data fresh
- **AND** offline capability is maintained for PWA requirements

#### Scenario: Optimistic updates
- **WHEN** user performs data modifications
- **THEN** UI updates immediately with expected result
- **AND** actual database operation completes in background
- **AND** rollback handles failed operations transparently

#### Scenario: Loading state management
- **WHEN** data operations are in progress
- **THEN** appropriate loading indicators are shown
- **AND** user interactions are disabled during critical operations
- **AND** skeleton screens provide perceived performance improvements

### Requirement: Error Handling and User Feedback
All client-side operations SHALL provide comprehensive error handling and user feedback.

#### Scenario: Network error handling
- **WHEN** network connectivity issues occur
- **THEN** graceful error messages inform users of issues
- **AND** retry mechanisms attempt to recover automatically
- **AND** offline mode functionality is maintained where possible

#### Scenario: Validation error handling
- **WHEN** data validation fails on client or server side
- **THEN** clear validation messages guide users to correct issues
- **AND** form fields highlight validation problems
- **AND** validation rules are enforced consistently

#### Scenario: Permission error handling
- **WHEN** users attempt unauthorized operations
- **THEN** informative error messages explain permission restrictions
- **AND** appropriate UI elements are disabled or hidden
- **AND** users are guided to proper authorization flows

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The application SHALL implement client-side performance optimizations for Supabase operations.

#### Scenario: Query optimization
- **WHEN** data is requested from Supabase
- **THEN** queries select only required fields to minimize data transfer
- **AND** appropriate indexes are utilized for fast queries
- **AND** query batching reduces round trips to database

#### Scenario: Real-time subscription management
- **WHEN** real-time data updates are required
- **THEN** subscriptions are created only for necessary data
- **AND** subscriptions are properly cleaned up when components unmount
- **AND** subscription updates are debounced to prevent excessive re-renders

#### Scenario: Bundle optimization
- **WHEN** application is built for production
- **THEN** Supabase client library is properly code-split
- **AND** unused database operations are tree-shaken from bundle
- **AND** client-side database operations do not impact initial load performance
