## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: User Authentication
User authentication SHALL use client-side Supabase browser client instead of server-side API endpoints.

#### Scenario: User login
- **WHEN** user enters credentials and submits login form
- **THEN** Supabase browser client signInWithPassword is called directly
- **AND** session is established client-side without server API calls
- **AND** user is redirected to admin dashboard on success

#### Scenario: User logout
- **WHEN** user clicks logout button
- **THEN** Supabase browser client signOut is called directly
- **AND** session is cleared client-side
- **AND** user is redirected to login page

#### Scenario: Session persistence
- **WHEN** user refreshes the page or closes browser
- **THEN** Supabase browser client maintains session state
- **AND** user remains logged in if session is valid
- **AND** authentication state is properly managed across page loads

#### Scenario: Authentication state monitoring
- **WHEN** authentication state changes (login/logout/session expiry)
- **THEN** React components automatically update to reflect new state
- **AND** protected routes redirect appropriately
- **AND** UI components show correct authentication status

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Client-Side Session Management
The application SHALL manage authentication sessions entirely on the client side.

#### Scenario: Session validation
- **WHEN** application loads or authentication state is checked
- **THEN** Supabase browser client validates current session
- **AND** protected routes handle unauthenticated access appropriately
- **AND** loading states are shown during session validation

#### Scenario: Token refresh
- **WHEN** authentication tokens expire or need refresh
- **THEN** Supabase browser client automatically handles token refresh
- **AND** user experience is not interrupted by token management

#### Scenario: Authentication error handling
- **WHEN** authentication operations fail (invalid credentials, network issues)
- **THEN** appropriate error messages are displayed to user
- **AND** detailed error information is logged for debugging
- **AND** user can retry authentication operations

### Requirement: Authentication Context Provider
The application SHALL provide a React context for managing authentication state across the application.

#### Scenario: Global authentication state
- **WHEN** any component needs authentication information
- **THEN** authentication context provides current user state
- **AND** loading states are available during authentication operations
- **AND** authentication methods are accessible from context

#### Scenario: Protected route access
- **WHEN** user attempts to access protected routes
- **THEN** authentication context validates user permissions
- **AND** unauthorized users are redirected to login page
- **AND** authorized users can access protected content
