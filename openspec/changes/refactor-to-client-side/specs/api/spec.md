## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Server-Side API Routes
**Reason**: Server-side API routes cause 405/500 deployment errors on Vercel and will be replaced with client-side Supabase operations
**Migration**: All API functionality will be implemented using client-side Supabase browser client calls

#### Scenario: API route removal
- **WHEN** application is refactored to client-side
- **THEN** all `/src/app/api/` routes are removed
- **AND** functionality is moved to client-side Supabase operations

### Requirement: Server-Side Authentication Endpoints
**Reason**: Server-side auth endpoints are unreliable in production and will be replaced with client-side Supabase auth
**Migration**: Authentication will use Supabase browser client with proper session management

#### Scenario: Auth endpoint migration
- **WHEN** user attempts login
- **THEN** authentication uses client-side Supabase auth
- **AND** no server-side API calls are made for auth

### Requirement: Server-Side CRUD Operations
**Reason**: Server-side CRUD operations through API routes will be replaced with direct client-side database operations
**Migration**: All create, read, update, delete operations will use Supabase browser client

#### Scenario: CRUD operation migration
- **WHEN** frontend needs data operations
- **THEN** operations use client-side Supabase client
- **AND** Row Level Security (RLS) protects data access

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Client-Side Supabase Operations
All database operations SHALL use the Supabase browser client directly from the frontend.

#### Scenario: Direct database access
- **WHEN** frontend needs to perform CRUD operations
- **THEN** Supabase browser client is used directly
- **AND** operations are protected by Row Level Security policies

#### Scenario: Authentication flow
- **WHEN** user logs in or signs up
- **THEN** Supabase browser client handles authentication
- **AND** session state is managed client-side

### Requirement: Row Level Security (RLS)
All database tables SHALL have Row Level Security policies to protect data when accessed from client-side.

#### Scenario: Data access control
- **WHEN** client accesses database tables
- **THEN** RLS policies enforce appropriate access rules
- **AND** users can only access data they are authorized to see

#### Scenario: Admin access protection
- **WHEN** non-admin user attempts to access admin data
- **THEN** RLS policies block unauthorized access
- **AND** appropriate error is returned to client

### Requirement: Client-Side Error Handling
All client-side operations SHALL implement proper error handling and user feedback.

#### Scenario: Operation failure
- **WHEN** Supabase operation fails
- **THEN** appropriate error message is displayed to user
- **AND** error details are logged for debugging

#### Scenario: Network issues
- **WHEN** network connectivity is lost
- **THEN** graceful error handling is provided
- **AND** retry mechanisms are implemented where appropriate
