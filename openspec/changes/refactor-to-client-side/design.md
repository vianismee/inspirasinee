## Context
The current Next.js server-side API routes are failing in Vercel production deployment with 405 and 500 errors. This blocks all user authentication and data operations, making the application unusable. Client-side Supabase operations will bypass server-side deployment issues while maintaining functionality.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: Eliminate server-side API route deployment failures, maintain all existing functionality, improve reliability
- Non-Goals: Change UI/UX, modify business logic, change database schema

## Decisions
- **Decision**: Migrate all API routes to client-side Supabase operations
  - **Why**: Eliminates Vercel server-side deployment issues, more reliable authentication flow
  - **Alternatives considered**:
    - Fix API route issues (tried multiple approaches, still failing)
    - Move to different hosting platform (adds complexity and cost)
    - Use edge functions (still server-side complexity)
- **Decision**: Use browser Supabase client instead of server client
  - **Why**: Direct client access eliminates server middleware issues
  - **Security**: Will implement RLS policies for data protection
- **Decision**: Keep all existing functionality unchanged
  - **Why**: Users should not notice any difference in behavior

## Risks / Trade-offs
- **Security Risk**: Client-side operations exposed to browser
  - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- **Performance Risk**: Multiple client calls instead of single API call
  - **Mitigation**: Use Supabase query optimization and client-side caching
- **Complexity Risk**: Need to handle authentication state on client
  - **Mitigation**: Use React Context and state management patterns

## Migration Plan
1. Setup client-side Supabase configuration
2. Implement RLS policies for all tables
3. Replace authentication logic with client-side auth
4. Convert API routes to client-side operations (grouped by feature)
5. Update all frontend components to use new client-side functions
6. Remove all API route files
7. Update error handling and loading states
8. Test all functionality end-to-end
9. Deploy and verify production functionality

## Open Questions
- Should we implement optimistic updates for better UX?
- Do we need client-side caching for frequently accessed data?
- How to handle offline scenarios with PWA requirements?
